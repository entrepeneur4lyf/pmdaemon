Valid statuses: `starting`, `online`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `errored`, `restarting`\n- **Force flag**: Added `--force` / `-f` flag to skip confirmation prompts for automation\n- **Safety confirmations**: Interactive prompts for bulk operations to prevent accidental deletions\n- **Process shutdown**: All delete operations now properly stop running processes before deletion\n- **Enhanced feedback**: Clear reporting of how many processes were stopped vs. deleted\n\n```bash\n# Delete all stopped processes\npmdaemon delete stopped --status --force\n\n# Delete all processes with confirmation\npmdaemon delete all\n\n# Force delete without prompts (for scripts)\npmdaemon delete all --force\n```\n\n### Health Checks & Monitoring\n\nAdvanced health monitoring capabilities that go beyond basic process tracking:\n\n- **HTTP Health Checks**: Monitor process health via HTTP endpoints (`--health-check-url`)\n- **Script-based Health Checks**: Custom health check scripts for complex validation (`--health-check-script`)\n- **Configurable Health Parameters**: Timeout (`--health-check-timeout`), interval, and retry settings (`--health-check-retries`)\n- **Health-based Auto-restart**: Automatic restart when health checks fail\n- **Monitoring Integration**: Health status visible in process listings (`pmdaemon monit`) and web API\n\n```bash\n# Start with HTTP health check\npmdaemon start app.js --health-check-url http://localhost:3000/health\n\n# Start with custom health script\npmdaemon start app.js --health-check-script ./health-check.sh\n```\n\n### Blocking Start Command\n\nPerfect for deployment scripts that need to wait for services to be ready:\n\n- **Wait for Ready**: Block start command until processes are healthy (`--wait-ready`)\n- **Configurable Wait Timeout**: Set maximum wait time for process readiness (`--wait-timeout`)\n- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time status updates during health check waiting\n- **Script-friendly**: Ideal for deployment scripts that need to wait for services\n\n```bash\n# Wait for process to be healthy before continuing\npmdaemon start app.js --wait-ready --wait-timeout 30s\n```\n\n### Configurable Monitoring Intervals\n\nOptimize monitoring performance for your specific needs:\n\n- **Library**: Added `monitor_with_interval(Duration)` method for configurable update intervals\n- **CLI**: Added `--interval` / `-i` flag to `monit` command for custom refresh rates\n- **Performance optimization**: Users can now balance responsiveness vs. resource usage:\n  - Fast updates (1s) for debugging and development\n  - Balanced updates (2s) for general use (library default)\n  - Slower updates (5s+) for reduced system load\n\n```bash\n# Monitor with 5-second intervals\npmdaemon monit --interval 5\n```\n\n## 🔧 Enhanced Features\n\n### Professional Monitoring Display\n\n- **Beautiful table formatting**: Integrated `comfy-table` for professional display\n- **Color-coded status indicators**:\n  - 🟢 Green for Online processes\n  - 🔴 Red for Stopped/Errored processes\n  - 🟡 Yellow for Starting/Stopping processes\n  - 🔵 Blue for Restarting processes\n- **PID column**: Added Process ID display for better debugging and system integration\n- **Enhanced system overview**: Improved system metrics display with proper formatting\n\n### Enhanced Log Management\n\n- **Real-time log following**: Implemented `follow_logs()` method with `tail -f` functionality\n- **Configurable log retrieval**: Enhanced `get_logs()` method with proper line limiting\n- **Missing file handling**: Graceful handling of non-existent log files\n- **CLI integration**: `pmdaemon logs --follow` for real-time log monitoring\n\n## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing\n\nThis release significantly expands our test coverage:\n\n- **Test count**: 267 total tests (up from 158 before health checks & blocking start)\n- **New coverage**: Delete operations (bulk, status-based, safe shutdown), Health Checks (HTTP, script, params), Blocking Start (`--wait-ready`, `--wait-timeout`), CLI argument parsing and utility functions, and process lifecycle management.\n- **Enhanced test suites**: Added comprehensive tests for all new delete, health check, blocking start functionality, and complete CLI binary test coverage.\n- **Quality**: 100% test success rate with comprehensive error path testing and 80%+ code coverage.\n\n## 🐛 Bug Fixes\n\n- **Production-ready code**: Eliminated all TODO comments from production codebase\n- **Thread safety**: Improved async/await patterns and lock management\n- **Memory efficiency**: Optimized file reading and monitoring operations\n\n## 📊 Technical Details\n\n- **Dependencies**: Added `comfy-table` for professional table formatting\n- **Performance**: Configurable intervals allow optimization for different use cases. Health checks add minimal overhead\n- **Compatibility**: Backward compatible - no breaking changes to existing API\n\n## Download & Install\n\n```bash\n# Install from crates.io\ncargo install pmdaemon\n\n# Or build from source\ngit clone https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/pmdaemon.git\ncd pmdaemon\ncargo build --release\n```\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe're continuing to enhance PMDaemon with more advanced features.
