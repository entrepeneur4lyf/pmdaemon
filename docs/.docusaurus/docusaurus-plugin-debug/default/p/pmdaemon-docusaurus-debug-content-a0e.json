PMDaemon now properly tracks process PIDs, maintains consistent UUIDs across restarts, detects ports from application logs, and performs complete cleanup operations without leaving zombie processes.\n\n## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes\n\n### 🔍 Process Monitoring & State Tracking\n- **Fixed PID Detection** - Process PIDs now display correctly instead of showing \"-\"\n- **Fixed Port Detection** - Ports are now properly detected and displayed in the process list\n- **Fixed UUID Persistence** - Process IDs remain consistent across PMDaemon restarts\n- **Enhanced State Restoration** - Processes are properly restored with all metadata after daemon restarts\n\n### 🧹 Process Lifecycle Management\n- **Fixed Zombie Process Bug** - `delete all` command now properly removes all processes and configuration files\n- **Enhanced Cleanup Operations** - Metadata files are properly created and removed during process lifecycle\n- **Improved Error Handling** - Better error reporting during cleanup operations\n\n### 📊 Monitoring & Logging\n- **Enhanced Log Reading** - Improved debugging and error reporting for log operations\n- **Port Detection from Logs** - Automatically detects ports from application output (e.g., \"Server bound to 127.0.0.1:3000\")\n- **Real-time Monitoring** - Fixed issues with the `monit` command displaying accurate process information\n\n## ✨ Technical Improvements\n\n### 🗄️ Metadata Persistence System\n- **New Metadata Files** - Process runtime state is now saved to `.meta.json` files\n- **Comprehensive State Tracking** - Stores process IDs, assigned ports, PIDs, and instance numbers\n- **Automatic Restoration** - All metadata is automatically restored when PMDaemon restarts\n\n### 🔧 Enhanced Process Management\n- **Stored PID Field** - New field to track PIDs when process handles are unavailable\n- **Improved Loading Logic** - Fixed issue where metadata files were incorrectly loaded as process configurations\n- **Better Port Management** - Enhanced port allocation and persistence across restarts\n\n## 🚀 Before vs After\n\n### Process Monitoring Display\n**Before v0.1.3:**\n```\n│ ID       ┆ Name        ┆ Status ┆ PID ┆ Port │\n│ fa007933 ┆ my-app      ┆ online ┆ -   ┆ -    │\n```\n\n**After v0.1.3:**\n```\n│ ID       ┆ Name        ┆ Status ┆ PID     ┆ Port  │\n│ fa007933 ┆ my-app      ┆ online ┆ 2642197 ┆ 3000  │\n```\n\n### Delete All Operation\n**Before v0.1.3:**\n- Left zombie processes in the list\n- Incomplete file cleanup\n- Phantom processes after restart\n\n**After v0.1.3:**\n- Complete process removal\n- All configuration and metadata files cleaned up\n- Clean state after `delete all`\n\n## 🔍 What Was Fixed\n\n### 1. PID Tracking Issue\n- **Problem**: PIDs showed as \"-\" even for running processes\n- **Root Cause**: Process handles couldn't be restored after PMDaemon restart\n- **Solution**: Added `stored_pid` field to persist PIDs in metadata files\n\n### 2. Port Detection Issue  \n- **Problem**: Ports showed as \"-\" even when processes were bound to specific ports\n- **Root Cause**: Port information wasn't persisted and couldn't be detected from logs\n- **Solution**: Added port detection from log output and metadata persistence\n\n### 3. UUID Consistency Issue\n- **Problem**: Process IDs changed on every PMDaemon restart\n- **Root Cause**: New UUIDs were generated instead of restoring saved ones\n- **Solution**: Added UUID persistence in metadata files\n\n### 4. Zombie Process Bug\n- **Problem**: `delete all` left phantom processes and incomplete cleanup\n- **Root Cause**: Metadata files were loaded as process configurations\n- **Solution**: Fixed loading logic to exclude `.meta.json` files from process loading\n\n## 📊 Technical Details\n\n- **New Dependencies**: Added `regex` crate for log parsing\n- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error reporting during cleanup operations\n- **Improved Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting\n- **Metadata System**: Complete runtime state persistence and restoration\n\n## 🆚 Reliability Improvements\n\n| Issue                    | Before v0.1.3 | After v0.1.3 |\n|--------------------------|:--------------:|:------------:|\n| **PID Display**          | ❌ Shows \"-\"   | ✅ Shows actual PID |\n| **Port Display**         | ❌ Shows \"-\"   | ✅ Shows actual port |\n| **UUID Consistency**     | ❌ Changes each restart | ✅ Persistent across restarts |\n| **Delete All Cleanup**   | ❌ Leaves zombies | ✅ Complete cleanup |\n| **State Restoration**    | ❌ Partial     | ✅ Complete |\n| **Log-based Port Detection** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Automatic detection |\n\n## 🔗 Resources\n\n- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/pmdaemon)** - Source code and issue tracking\n- **[Documentation](https://entrepeneur4lyf.github.io/pmdaemon)** - Complete usage guide\n\n---\n\nPMDaemon v0.1.3 represents a major stability milestone, resolving all critical operational issues and making PMDaemon truly production-ready.
