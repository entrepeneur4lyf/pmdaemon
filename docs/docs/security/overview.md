# Security Overview

PMDaemon provides multiple layers of security to protect your applications and the daemon itself. This guide covers security features, best practices, and configuration options.

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Authentication

PMDaemon supports multiple authentication methods for securing API access:

#### Token-Based Authentication
```toml
[security.auth]
method = "token"
secret_key = "your-secret-key-here"
token_expiry = 3600  # seconds
```

#### JWT Authentication
```toml
[security.auth]
method = "jwt"
jwt_secret = "your-jwt-secret"
jwt_algorithm = "HS256"
issuer = "pmdaemon"
audience = "api-clients"
```

#### Basic Authentication
```toml
[security.auth]
method = "basic"
username = "admin"
password_hash = "$2b$10$..."  # bcrypt hash
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Define user roles and permissions:

```toml
[security.rbac]
enabled = true

[security.rbac.roles.admin]
permissions = ["*"]  # All permissions

[security.rbac.roles.operator]
permissions = [
  "process:start",
  "process:stop",
  "process:restart",
  "process:read"
]

[security.rbac.roles.viewer]
permissions = ["process:read", "logs:read"]
```

### User Management
```toml
[security.users.admin]
password_hash = "$2b$10$..."
roles = ["admin"]

[security.users.ops_team]
password_hash = "$2b$10$..."
roles = ["operator"]
```

## Network Security

### TLS/SSL Configuration

#### HTTPS API Server
```toml
[server.tls]
enabled = true
cert_file = "/path/to/certificate.pem"
key_file = "/path/to/private-key.pem"
ca_file = "/path/to/ca-bundle.pem"  # Optional
```

#### Certificate Management
```toml
[server.tls]
auto_cert = true  # Enable automatic certificate generation
cert_domains = ["pmdaemon.example.com"]
acme_email = "admin@example.com"
```

### Network Access Control

#### IP Whitelisting
```toml
[security.network]
allowed_ips = [
  "192.168.1.0/24",
  "10.0.0.0/8",
  "127.0.0.1"
]
blocked_ips = [
  "192.168.1.100"
]
```

#### Port Security
```toml
[security.network]
# Bind to specific interfaces
bind_address = "127.0.0.1"  # Local only
# bind_address = "0.0.0.0"  # All interfaces (less secure)

# Custom port for security through obscurity
port = 8443  # Instead of default 3000
```

### Firewall Integration
```toml
[security.firewall]
enabled = true
default_policy = "deny"
rules = [
  { action = "allow", port = 8443, source = "192.168.1.0/24" },
  { action = "allow", port = 22, source = "admin_network" }
]
```

## Process Security

### Process Isolation

#### User/Group Isolation
```toml
[app.myapp.security]
# Run process as specific user/group
user = "webapp"
group = "webapp"
umask = "0027"  # Restrictive file permissions
```

#### Directory Restrictions
```toml
[app.myapp.security]
# Restrict process to specific directories
chroot = "/var/lib/myapp"
working_dir = "/var/lib/myapp"
temp_dir = "/var/lib/myapp/tmp"
```

#### Resource Limits
```toml
[app.myapp.security]
# Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
max_memory = "512MB"
max_cpu = 50  # percentage
max_files = 1024
max_processes = 10
```

### Environment Security

#### Environment Variable Sanitization
```toml
[app.myapp.security]
# Remove sensitive environment variables
env_blacklist = ["AWS_SECRET", "DB_PASSWORD"]
# Only allow specific environment variables
env_whitelist = ["NODE_ENV", "PORT", "LOG_LEVEL"]
```

#### Secure Environment Injection
```toml
[app.myapp.env_secure]
# Encrypted environment variables
DATABASE_URL = { encrypted = "encrypted_value_here" }
API_KEY = { vault = "secret/api-key" }
```

## Data Security

### Log Security

#### Log Sanitization
```toml
[logging.security]
# Remove sensitive data from logs
sanitize_patterns = [
  "password=\\w+",
  "token=\\w+",
  "\\b\\d{4}-\\d{4}-\\d{4}-\\d{4}\\b"  # Credit card numbers
]
replacement = "[REDACTED]"
```

#### Log Encryption
```toml
[logging.security]
encrypt_logs = true
encryption_key = "your-encryption-key"
cipher = "aes-256-gcm"
```

### Configuration Security

#### Encrypted Configuration
```toml
[security.config]
encrypt_sensitive = true
encryption_key_file = "/etc/pmdaemon/encryption.key"
```

#### Configuration Validation
```toml
[security.config]
validate_schema = true
schema_file = "/etc/pmdaemon/config.schema.json"
strict_mode = true
```

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Monitoring

#### Failed Authentication Tracking
```toml
[security.monitoring]
track_failed_auth = true
max_failed_attempts = 5
lockout_duration = 300  # seconds
alert_on_repeated_failures = true
```

#### Suspicious Activity Detection
```toml
[security.monitoring]
detect_anomalies = true
alert_on_privilege_escalation = true
monitor_file_access = true
track_network_connections = true
```

### Audit Logging

#### Security Event Logging
```toml
[security.audit]
enabled = true
log_file = "/var/log/pmdaemon/security.log"
events = [
  "authentication",
  "authorization",
  "process_start",
  "process_stop",
  "config_change",
  "file_access"
]
```

#### Compliance Logging
```toml
[security.audit]
format = "json"
include_request_details = true
include_response_data = false
retention_days = 90
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Updates

#### Automatic Security Updates
```toml
[security.updates]
auto_update = true
security_only = true
update_check_interval = 86400  # daily
```

#### Dependency Scanning
```toml
[security.scanning]
scan_dependencies = true
vulnerability_database = "/var/lib/pmdaemon/vuln.db"
alert_on_critical = true
```

### Security Hardening

#### System Hardening Checklist
- [ ] Run PMDaemon as non-root user
- [ ] Use dedicated user accounts for applications
- [ ] Enable TLS for all network communication
- [ ] Implement proper firewall rules
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Monitor security logs
- [ ] Use strong authentication methods
- [ ] Implement principle of least privilege

#### Container Security (if using containers)
```toml
[app.myapp.container.security]
read_only_root = true
no_new_privileges = true
drop_capabilities = ["ALL"]
add_capabilities = ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
```

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Detection
```toml
[security.incident_response]
enabled = true
alert_threshold = "medium"
notification_channels = ["email", "slack"]
```

### Automated Response
```toml
[security.incident_response.automation]
# Automatic actions on security events
block_suspicious_ips = true
kill_compromised_processes = true
backup_logs = true
notify_administrators = true
```

### Recovery Procedures
```toml
[security.recovery]
backup_config = true
backup_logs = true
emergency_shutdown = true
safe_mode_enabled = true
```

## Security Best Practices

### Configuration Security
1. **Use Strong Authentication**: Always enable authentication in production
2. **Encrypt Communications**: Use TLS for all network traffic
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep PMDaemon and dependencies up to date
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Set up comprehensive security monitoring

### Operational Security
1. **Secure Deployment**: Use secure deployment practices
2. **Environment Separation**: Separate development, staging, and production
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls
4. **Backup Security**: Secure backup storage and access
5. **Incident Response**: Have a security incident response plan

### Development Security
1. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
2. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update dependencies
3. **Code Review**: Implement security-focused code reviews
4. **Testing**: Include security testing in your CI/CD pipeline
5. **Documentation**: Document security configurations and procedures
