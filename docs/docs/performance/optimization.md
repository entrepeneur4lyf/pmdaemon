# Performance Optimization

This guide covers strategies and techniques for optimizing PMDaemon performance and the applications it manages.

## PMDaemon Performance Tuning

### Resource Allocation

#### CPU Optimization
```toml
[daemon]
# Adjust worker threads for concurrent operations
worker_threads = 4  # Recommended: CPU cores

# Optimize event loop performance
max_events_per_tick = 1000
event_loop_delay_threshold = 50  # milliseconds
```

#### Memory Management
```toml
[daemon]
# Set memory limits for the daemon itself
max_memory = "512MB"
gc_interval = 30  # seconds

# Enable memory monitoring
memory_monitoring = true
heap_dump_on_oom = true
```

### I/O Optimization

#### File System Operations
```toml
[daemon.io]
# Optimize log file operations
log_buffer_size = "64KB"
log_sync_interval = 5  # seconds

# Process file monitoring
file_watch_debounce = 100  # milliseconds
```

#### Network Performance
```toml
[daemon.network]
# HTTP server tuning
keep_alive_timeout = 65
max_connections = 1000
request_timeout = 30
```

## Application Performance Optimization

### Process Configuration

#### Instance Scaling
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Optimize instance count
instances = 4  # Match CPU cores for CPU-bound apps
instances = "max"  # Use all available cores

# Load balancing for better distribution
exec_mode = "cluster"
```

#### Resource Limits
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Set appropriate limits to prevent resource exhaustion
max_memory_restart = "1GB"
max_restarts = 10
min_uptime = "10s"

# CPU limits (Linux only)
cpu_limit = 80  # percentage
```

### Memory Optimization

#### Memory Management Strategies
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Enable memory monitoring
memory_monitoring = true
kill_timeout = 1600  # Give app time to cleanup

# Automatic restart on memory issues
max_memory_restart = "1GB"
memory_threshold = 90  # percentage
```

#### Garbage Collection Tuning (Node.js)
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Node.js specific optimizations
node_args = [
  "--max-old-space-size=1024",
  "--optimize-for-size",
  "--gc-interval=100"
]
```

### CPU Optimization

#### CPU Affinity (Linux)
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Bind processes to specific CPU cores
cpu_affinity = [0, 1]  # Use cores 0 and 1
```

#### Process Priority
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Adjust process priority (-20 to 20)
nice = -5  # Higher priority for critical apps
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Application Metrics
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rates
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization

#### System Metrics
- Load average
- Memory pressure
- Disk I/O
- Network latency

### Performance Profiling

#### Built-in Profiling
```bash
# Enable performance profiling
pmdaemon profile start myapp

# View performance report
pmdaemon profile report myapp

# Stop profiling
pmdaemon profile stop myapp
```

#### Custom Performance Hooks
```toml
[app.myapp.performance]
# Enable custom performance tracking
enable_hooks = true
track_memory = true
track_cpu = true
sample_interval = 1000  # milliseconds
```

## Optimization Strategies

### Application-Level Optimizations

#### Database Optimization
- Use connection pooling
- Implement query caching
- Optimize database indexes
- Use read replicas for scaling

#### Caching Strategies
```toml
[app.myapp.cache]
# Application-level caching
redis_host = "localhost"
redis_port = 6379
cache_ttl = 3600  # seconds
```

#### Asynchronous Processing
- Use message queues for heavy operations
- Implement background job processing
- Utilize worker processes for CPU-intensive tasks

### Infrastructure Optimization

#### Load Balancing
```toml
[load_balancer]
# Optimize load balancing algorithm
algorithm = "least_connections"  # or "round_robin", "ip_hash"
health_check_interval = 10
session_affinity = false
```

#### Process Distribution
```toml
[app.myapp]
# Distribute processes across available resources
instances = "max"
exec_mode = "cluster"
instance_var = "INSTANCE_ID"
```

## Performance Benchmarking

### Load Testing Integration
```bash
# Run performance tests with different configurations
pmdaemon benchmark --app myapp --duration 60s --concurrent 100
```

### Performance Regression Testing
```toml
[performance.testing]
# Automated performance testing
baseline_file = "performance.baseline.json"
threshold_cpu = 80
threshold_memory = 1024
threshold_response_time = 200  # milliseconds
```

## Common Performance Issues

### Memory Leaks
**Symptoms**: Gradually increasing memory usage
**Solutions**:
- Enable automatic restart on memory threshold
- Implement proper cleanup in application code
- Use memory profiling tools

### CPU Bottlenecks
**Symptoms**: High CPU usage, slow response times
**Solutions**:
- Scale horizontally with more instances
- Optimize application algorithms
- Use caching to reduce computation

### I/O Bottlenecks
**Symptoms**: High wait times, slow file operations
**Solutions**:
- Use asynchronous I/O operations
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize database queries

### Event Loop Blocking (Node.js)
**Symptoms**: Unresponsive application, high event loop delay
**Solutions**:
- Move CPU-intensive operations to worker threads
- Use streaming for large data processing
- Implement proper error handling

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Monitor Continuously**: Set up comprehensive monitoring from day one
2. **Establish Baselines**: Record performance metrics during normal operation
3. **Test Under Load**: Regularly perform load testing to identify bottlenecks
4. **Optimize Gradually**: Make incremental improvements and measure impact
5. **Plan for Growth**: Design for scalability from the beginning
6. **Use Profiling Tools**: Leverage built-in and third-party profiling tools
7. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regular updates often include performance improvements
8. **Implement Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data and computations
