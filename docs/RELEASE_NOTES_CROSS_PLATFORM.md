- **Windows Terminal** support with full color output

### Native macOS Support  
- **Intel Mac** support (x86_64)
- **Apple Silicon** support (aarch64) 
- **Unified binary** works on both architectures
- **macOS-optimized** signal handling and process management

### Enhanced Linux Support
- **Improved performance** with platform-specific optimizations
- **Better signal handling** with comprehensive Unix signal support
- **Container-ready** for Docker and Kubernetes deployments

## üì¶ Download Options

### Pre-built Binaries
- **Linux**: `pmdaemon-linux-x86_64`
- **Windows**: `pmdaemon-windows-x86_64.exe` 
- **macOS Intel**: `pmdaemon-macos-x86_64`
- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `pmdaemon-macos-aarch64`

### Package Managers
```bash
# All platforms
cargo install pmdaemon

# From source
git clone https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/pmdaemon
cd pmdaemon
cargo build --release
```

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Cross-Platform Architecture
- **Conditional compilation** for platform-specific optimizations
- **Unified API** - same commands work identically on all platforms
- **Platform-aware error handling** with OS-specific error messages
- **Zero-cost abstractions** for cross-platform compatibility

### Dependency Cleanup
- **Removed unused dependencies** that blocked cross-platform builds
- **Conditional dependencies** - only include what's needed per platform
- **Smaller binary sizes** due to dependency optimization

### Signal Handling Enhancements
- **Unix platforms**: Full SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGKILL support
- **Windows**: Native Ctrl+C handling and taskkill integration
- **Graceful shutdown** on all platforms with platform-appropriate methods

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Testing
- **267 total tests** pass on all platforms
- **Cross-platform CI** ensures compatibility
- **Platform-specific test suites** for OS-specific functionality
- **End-to-end testing** on real Windows, macOS, and Linux environments

### No Feature Reduction
- **100% feature parity** across all platforms
- **Same CLI commands** work identically everywhere
- **Consistent behavior** regardless of operating system
- **No platform-specific limitations**

## üéØ Use Cases

### Development Teams
- **Consistent tooling** across Windows, macOS, and Linux developers
- **Same commands** work in all development environments
- **Cross-platform deployment** from any development machine

### Production Deployments
- **Linux servers** for production workloads
- **Windows servers** for .NET and Windows-specific applications  
- **macOS servers** for iOS/macOS development pipelines

### DevOps & CI/CD
- **Container deployments** on Linux
- **Windows containers** for Windows applications
- **Multi-platform builds** in CI/CD pipelines

## üîÆ What's Next

This cross-platform release sets the foundation for:
- **Automated release pipelines** with platform-specific binaries
- **Package manager distribution** (Homebrew, Chocolatey, etc.)
- **Container images** for multiple architectures
- **Enhanced platform integrations** (Windows Services, macOS LaunchAgents)

## üôè Community Impact

PMDaemon is now accessible to the entire development community:
- **Windows developers** can use PMDaemon natively
- **macOS developers** get full Apple Silicon support
- **Linux users** benefit from continued optimizations
- **Cross-platform teams** can standardize on one tool
