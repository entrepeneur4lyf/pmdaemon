# PMDaemon v0.1.4 - Documentation Accuracy & Stability

*Released on May 29, 2025*

PMDaemon v0.1.4 represents a **critical documentation accuracy release** that fixes major discrepancies between documentation and actual implementation. This release ensures users can rely on the documentation to accurately reflect PMDaemon's capabilities.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- **📚 Documentation Accuracy** - Fixed major discrepancies between docs and implementation
- **🔒 Security Hardening** - Removed dangerous API endpoints and improved security model
- **🐛 Critical Bug Fix** - Fixed uptime monitoring showing 0s for all processes
- **✅ Production Ready** - Documentation now accurately reflects actual capabilities

## 📚 Documentation Overhaul

### Fixed Major Inaccuracies

#### **Load Balancing Documentation**
- **Before**: Claimed enterprise-grade load balancing with round-robin algorithms, SSL termination
- **After**: Accurately describes clustering capabilities with external load balancer integration
- **Impact**: Users now understand PMDaemon focuses on process management, not traffic routing

#### **API Error Format**  
- **Before**: Complex nested error structure with codes, details, timestamps
- **After**: Simple `{"success": false, "error": "message"}` format matching implementation
- **Impact**: API integration code will work correctly

#### **CLI Parameters**
- **Before**: Extensive `--health-check-*` parameters that don't exist
- **After**: Removed all non-existent health check CLI parameters
- **Impact**: Users won't try to use parameters that cause errors

#### **Library API Methods**
- **Before**: Incorrect method names like `start_process()`, `wait_for_ready()`  
- **After**: Correct method names like `start()`, removed non-existent methods
- **Impact**: Rust library integration will compile and work

#### **Environment Variables**
- **Before**: 10+ fictional environment variables like `PMDAEMON_LOG_LEVEL`
- **After**: Only `PMDAEMON_HOME` (the one that actually works)
- **Impact**: Environment configuration will work as documented

#### **WebSocket API**
- **Before**: Claimed bidirectional communication with command sending
- **After**: Clearly marked as read-only for security
- **Impact**: Prevents security vulnerabilities from attempted command injection

#### **Watch Mode**
- **Before**: Working file watching examples throughout documentation
- **After**: Marked as "not yet implemented" with current status
- **Impact**: Users won't expect functionality that doesn't exist

#### **Installation Methods**
- **Before**: Claimed availability through package managers (Homebrew, apt, etc.)
- **After**: Accurately reflects pre-1.0 status with manual installation only
- **Impact**: Users know the actual installation methods

#### **Exit Codes**
- **Before**: Complex exit code system (0, 1, 2, 126, 127, etc.)
- **After**: Simple Unix standard (0=success, 1=error)
- **Impact**: Shell scripts will handle errors correctly

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Removed Dangerous API Endpoint
```bash
# This dangerous endpoint has been removed for security
# POST /api/processes - Could execute arbitrary commands
```

### Enhanced Authentication & API Key Management
- **Auto-generated API keys** - Secure keys created and saved automatically on first web server start
- **Persistent storage** - Keys saved to `~/.pmdaemon/api-key` and reused automatically
- **Simple management** - `show-api-key` and `regenerate-api-key` commands
- **Environment variable support** - `PMDAEMON_API_KEY` still works if needed
- **Cross-platform compatible** - Works reliably on Windows, Linux, and macOS

```bash
# Auto-generates secure API key on first run
pmdaemon web

# Key management commands
pmdaemon show-api-key        # Display current key
pmdaemon regenerate-api-key  # Generate new key
```

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed Uptime Monitoring
**Issue**: All processes showed 0s for uptime values
**Root Cause**: Monitoring data collected but never applied to processes  
**Fix**: Added proper monitoring data application in `update_monitoring_data()`

```rust
// Fixed in src/manager.rs
for (id, metrics) in monitoring_data {
    if let Some(process) = processes.get_mut(&id) {
        process.update_monitoring(metrics.cpu_usage, metrics.memory_usage);
    }
}
```

## 📊 Documentation Statistics

**Files Reviewed**: 35+ documentation files  
**Major Issues Fixed**: 15+ critical discrepancies  
**Lines Updated**: 500+ lines of corrections  
**Accuracy Improvement**: 🚫 Fictional → ✅ Accurate  

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

### Removed Features (That Never Existed)
- Health check CLI parameters (`--health-check-url`, etc.)
- Complex API error format
- Bidirectional WebSocket commands
- Most environment variables (only `PMDAEMON_HOME` works)
- Package manager installations

### API Changes
- Simplified error response format
- Removed dangerous process creation endpoint
- Enhanced authentication requirements

## 🏗️ Before vs After

| Feature | v0.1.3 Docs | v0.1.4 Reality |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Load Balancing** | ❌ Enterprise features | ✅ Process clustering |
| **Health Check CLI** | ❌ Extensive parameters | ✅ Config file only |
| **API Errors** | ❌ Complex nested format | ✅ Simple format |
| **Library Methods** | ❌ Wrong method names | ✅ Correct methods |
| **Environment Vars** | ❌ 10+ fictional vars | ✅ Only PMDAEMON_HOME |
| **WebSocket API** | ❌ Bidirectional claims | ✅ Read-only security |
| **Watch Mode** | ❌ Working examples | ✅ Not implemented |
| **Installation** | ❌ Package managers | ✅ Manual/source only |
| **Exit Codes** | ❌ Complex system | ✅ Unix standard |

## 📋 Migration Guide

### For CLI Users
```bash
# Remove health check parameters (they never worked)
# Before (would error):
pmdaemon start app.js --health-check-url http://localhost:3000/health

# After (works):
pmdaemon start app.js --name app
```

### For API Users  
```javascript
// Update error handling for correct format
// Before:
if (response.error.code === 'PROCESS_NOT_FOUND') 

// After:
if (!response.success && response.error === 'Process not found')
```

### For Library Users
```rust
// Update method names
// Before:
let id = manager.start_process(config).await?;

// After:  
let id = manager.start(config).await?;
```

## 🔮 Looking Forward

### Looking Forward to v0.1.5

- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper monitoring data management
- **Security**: Removed dangerous endpoints and improved authentication

## 🎯 Upgrade Instructions

### From v0.1.3
```bash
# 1. Download new binary or rebuild from source
cargo build --release

# 2. Update any scripts using removed CLI parameters

# 4. Update library code to use correct method names
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test uptime monitoring fix
pmdaemon start "sleep 60" --name test-uptime
pmdaemon list  # Should show actual uptime, not 0s

# Test API authentication
pmdaemon web --api-key "test-key"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-key" http://localhost:9615/api/processes
```

## 🤝 Community Impact
