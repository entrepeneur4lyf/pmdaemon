# PMDaemon v0.1.1 - Enhanced Delete Operations, Health Checks & Monitoring

We're excited to announce PMDaemon v0.1.1, a significant update that brings powerful new features for production environments, enhanced safety mechanisms, and comprehensive health monitoring capabilities.

## üöÄ Major New Features

### Enhanced Delete Operations

This release introduces robust bulk deletion capabilities with safety mechanisms:

- **Bulk deletion**: Added `delete all` command to stop and delete all processes at once
- **Status-based deletion**: Added `delete <status> --status` to delete processes by their current state
  - Valid statuses: `starting`, `online`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `errored`, `restarting`
- **Force flag**: Added `--force` / `-f` flag to skip confirmation prompts for automation
- **Safety confirmations**: Interactive prompts for bulk operations to prevent accidental deletions
- **Process shutdown**: All delete operations now properly stop running processes before deletion
- **Enhanced feedback**: Clear reporting of how many processes were stopped vs. deleted

```bash
# Delete all stopped processes
pmdaemon delete stopped --status --force

# Delete all processes with confirmation
pmdaemon delete all

# Force delete without prompts (for scripts)
pmdaemon delete all --force
```

### Health Checks & Monitoring

Advanced health monitoring capabilities that go beyond basic process tracking:

- **HTTP Health Checks**: Monitor process health via HTTP endpoints (`--health-check-url`)
- **Script-based Health Checks**: Custom health check scripts for complex validation (`--health-check-script`)
- **Configurable Health Parameters**: Timeout (`--health-check-timeout`), interval, and retry settings (`--health-check-retries`)
- **Health-based Auto-restart**: Automatic restart when health checks fail
- **Monitoring Integration**: Health status visible in process listings (`pmdaemon monit`) and web API

```bash
# Start with HTTP health check
pmdaemon start app.js --health-check-url http://localhost:3000/health

# Start with custom health script
pmdaemon start app.js --health-check-script ./health-check.sh
```

### Blocking Start Command

Perfect for deployment scripts that need to wait for services to be ready:

- **Wait for Ready**: Block start command until processes are healthy (`--wait-ready`)
- **Configurable Wait Timeout**: Set maximum wait time for process readiness (`--wait-timeout`)
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time status updates during health check waiting
- **Script-friendly**: Ideal for deployment scripts that need to wait for services

```bash
# Wait for process to be healthy before continuing
pmdaemon start app.js --wait-ready --wait-timeout 30s
```

### Configurable Monitoring Intervals

Optimize monitoring performance for your specific needs:

- **Library**: Added `monitor_with_interval(Duration)` method for configurable update intervals
- **CLI**: Added `--interval` / `-i` flag to `monit` command for custom refresh rates
- **Performance optimization**: Users can now balance responsiveness vs. resource usage:
  - Fast updates (1s) for debugging and development
  - Balanced updates (2s) for general use (library default)
  - Slower updates (5s+) for reduced system load

```bash
# Monitor with 5-second intervals
pmdaemon monit --interval 5
```

## üîß Enhanced Features

### Professional Monitoring Display

- **Beautiful table formatting**: Integrated `comfy-table` for professional display
- **Color-coded status indicators**:
  - üü¢ Green for Online processes
  - üî¥ Red for Stopped/Errored processes
  - üü° Yellow for Starting/Stopping processes
  - üîµ Blue for Restarting processes
- **PID column**: Added Process ID display for better debugging and system integration
- **Enhanced system overview**: Improved system metrics display with proper formatting

### Enhanced Log Management

- **Real-time log following**: Implemented `follow_logs()` method with `tail -f` functionality
- **Configurable log retrieval**: Enhanced `get_logs()` method with proper line limiting
- **Missing file handling**: Graceful handling of non-existent log files
- **CLI integration**: `pmdaemon logs --follow` for real-time log monitoring

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing

This release significantly expands our test coverage:

- **Test count**: 267 total tests (up from 158 before health checks & blocking start)
- **New coverage**: Delete operations (bulk, status-based, safe shutdown), Health Checks (HTTP, script, params), Blocking Start (`--wait-ready`, `--wait-timeout`), CLI argument parsing and utility functions, and process lifecycle management.
- **Enhanced test suites**: Added comprehensive tests for all new delete, health check, blocking start functionality, and complete CLI binary test coverage.
- **Quality**: 100% test success rate with comprehensive error path testing and 80%+ code coverage.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Production-ready code**: Eliminated all TODO comments from production codebase
- **Thread safety**: Improved async/await patterns and lock management
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimized file reading and monitoring operations

## üìä Technical Details

- **Dependencies**: Added `comfy-table` for professional table formatting
- **Performance**: Configurable intervals allow optimization for different use cases. Health checks add minimal overhead
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatible - no breaking changes to existing API
