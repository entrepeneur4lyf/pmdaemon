# PMDaemon v0.1.0 - Initial Release

We're thrilled to announce the initial release of PMDaemon, a high-performance process manager built in Rust that takes inspiration from PM2 while adding innovative features that exceed the original.

## üéØ Why PMDaemon?

PMDaemon was created to address the limitations of existing process managers while providing a familiar interface for PM2 users. Built with Rust, it offers memory safety, blazing performance, and advanced features not available in other process managers.

## üöÄ Core Features

### Complete Process Management

- **Lifecycle management**: Full control over process start, stop, restart, reload, and delete operations
- **Process clustering**: Automatic load balancing across multiple instances
- **Auto-restart on crash**: Configurable limits and intelligent restart logic
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT) for clean process termination
- **Configuration persistence**: Multi-session support with persistent process configurations

### Advanced Port Management (Beyond PM2)

One of PMDaemon's standout features is its sophisticated port management system:

- **Port range distribution**: Automatically distribute ports across cluster instances (`--port 3000-3003`)
- **Auto-assignment from ranges**: Smart port allocation (`--port auto:5000-5100`)
- **Built-in conflict detection**: Prevents port conflicts before they happen
- **Runtime port overrides**: Change ports without modifying configuration files
- **Port visibility**: See assigned ports in process listings

```bash
# Start a cluster with automatic port distribution
pmdaemon start app.js --instances 4 --port 3000-3003

# Auto-assign ports from a range
pmdaemon start api.js --port auto:8000-8100
```

### Real-time Monitoring

- **System metrics**: CPU, memory, uptime tracking with system-wide statistics
- **Load average monitoring**: Track system load across 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals
- **Memory limit enforcement**: Automatic restart when processes exceed memory limits
- **Process health checks**: Built-in health monitoring with auto-restart capabilities

### Professional CLI Interface

PMDaemon provides a familiar yet enhanced command-line experience:

- **PM2-compatible commands**: All the commands you know and love
- **Enhanced display**: Color-coded statuses and professional table formatting
- **Rich monitoring**: Real-time process monitoring with system overview

```bash
# Familiar PM2-style commands
pmdaemon start app.js --name my-app --instances 2
pmdaemon list
pmdaemon monit
pmdaemon logs my-app --follow
```

### Web API & WebSocket Support

- **REST API**: Complete process management via HTTP endpoints
- **PM2-compatible responses**: Drop-in replacement for PM2 API consumers
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket support for live process monitoring
- **Security**: CORS support and proper security headers

### Robust Log Management

- **Separate streams**: Individual stdout/stderr file handling
- **PID file management**: Proper process tracking and cleanup
- **Log viewing**: Built-in log viewing and following capabilities
- **Graceful handling**: Robust error handling for missing or corrupted log files

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Excellence

### Built with Rust

- **Memory safety**: Zero-cost abstractions without garbage collection overhead
- **Performance**: Native performance with minimal resource usage
- **Concurrency**: Async/await architecture using Tokio for efficient I/O

### Modern Architecture

- **Web server**: Powered by Axum for high-performance HTTP handling
- **System monitoring**: Leverages sysinfo for cross-platform system metrics
- **Cross-platform**: Full support for Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Comprehensive Testing

- **158 comprehensive tests**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, and documentation tests
- **Complete documentation**: Full Rust documentation with examples
- **Usage guides**: Comprehensive examples and migration guides

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install pmdaemon

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/pmdaemon.git
cd pmdaemon
cargo build --release
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start a simple application
pmdaemon start app.js --name my-app

# Start a cluster with port management
pmdaemon start server.js --instances 4 --port 3000-3003

# Monitor processes in real-time
pmdaemon monit

# View and follow logs
pmdaemon logs my-app --follow
```

### Migration from PM2

PMDaemon is designed to be a drop-in replacement for most PM2 use cases. Check out our [migration guide](/docs/getting-started/migration-from-pm2) for detailed instructions.

## üó∫Ô∏è What's Next

This initial release establishes PMDaemon as a robust, production-ready process manager. Future releases will continue to expand capabilities while maintaining the familiar interface that makes PMDaemon easy to adopt.
