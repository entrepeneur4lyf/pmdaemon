# PMDaemon v0.1.3 - Critical Bug Fixes & Enhanced State Persistence 🔧✨

We're excited to announce PMDaemon v0.1.3, a critical stability release that resolves major issues with process monitoring, state persistence, and cleanup operations. This release transforms PMDaemon from having significant operational issues to being a rock-solid, production-ready process manager.

<!-- truncate -->

## 🎉 What's New in v0.1.3

This release focuses entirely on **stability and reliability**, addressing critical bugs that affected core functionality. PMDaemon now properly tracks process PIDs, maintains consistent UUIDs across restarts, detects ports from application logs, and performs complete cleanup operations without leaving zombie processes.

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 🔍 Process Monitoring & State Tracking
- **Fixed PID Detection** - Process PIDs now display correctly instead of showing "-"
- **Fixed Port Detection** - Ports are now properly detected and displayed in the process list
- **Fixed UUID Persistence** - Process IDs remain consistent across PMDaemon restarts
- **Enhanced State Restoration** - Processes are properly restored with all metadata after daemon restarts

### 🧹 Process Lifecycle Management
- **Fixed Zombie Process Bug** - `delete all` command now properly removes all processes and configuration files
- **Enhanced Cleanup Operations** - Metadata files are properly created and removed during process lifecycle
- **Improved Error Handling** - Better error reporting during cleanup operations

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **Enhanced Log Reading** - Improved debugging and error reporting for log operations
- **Port Detection from Logs** - Automatically detects ports from application output (e.g., "Server bound to 127.0.0.1:3000")
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Fixed issues with the `monit` command displaying accurate process information

## ✨ Technical Improvements

### 🗄️ Metadata Persistence System
- **New Metadata Files** - Process runtime state is now saved to `.meta.json` files
- **Comprehensive State Tracking** - Stores process IDs, assigned ports, PIDs, and instance numbers
- **Automatic Restoration** - All metadata is automatically restored when PMDaemon restarts

### 🔧 Enhanced Process Management
- **Stored PID Field** - New field to track PIDs when process handles are unavailable
- **Improved Loading Logic** - Fixed issue where metadata files were incorrectly loaded as process configurations
- **Better Port Management** - Enhanced port allocation and persistence across restarts

## 🚀 Before vs After

### Process Monitoring Display
**Before v0.1.3:**
```
│ ID       ┆ Name        ┆ Status ┆ PID ┆ Port │
│ fa007933 ┆ my-app      ┆ online ┆ -   ┆ -    │
```

**After v0.1.3:**
```
│ ID       ┆ Name        ┆ Status ┆ PID     ┆ Port  │
│ fa007933 ┆ my-app      ┆ online ┆ 2642197 ┆ 3000  │
```

### Delete All Operation
**Before v0.1.3:**
- Left zombie processes in the list
- Incomplete file cleanup
- Phantom processes after restart

**After v0.1.3:**
- Complete process removal
- All configuration and metadata files cleaned up
- Clean state after `delete all`

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### 1. PID Tracking Issue
- **Problem**: PIDs showed as "-" even for running processes
- **Root Cause**: Process handles couldn't be restored after PMDaemon restart
- **Solution**: Added `stored_pid` field to persist PIDs in metadata files

### 2. Port Detection Issue  
- **Problem**: Ports showed as "-" even when processes were bound to specific ports
- **Root Cause**: Port information wasn't persisted and couldn't be detected from logs
- **Solution**: Added port detection from log output and metadata persistence

### 3. UUID Consistency Issue
- **Problem**: Process IDs changed on every PMDaemon restart
- **Root Cause**: New UUIDs were generated instead of restoring saved ones
- **Solution**: Added UUID persistence in metadata files

### 4. Zombie Process Bug
- **Problem**: `delete all` left phantom processes and incomplete cleanup
- **Root Cause**: Metadata files were loaded as process configurations
- **Solution**: Fixed loading logic to exclude `.meta.json` files from process loading

## 📊 Technical Details

- **New Dependencies**: Added `regex` crate for log parsing
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error reporting during cleanup operations
- **Improved Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Metadata System**: Complete runtime state persistence and restoration

## 🆚 Reliability Improvements

| Issue                    | Before v0.1.3 | After v0.1.3 |
|--------------------------|:--------------:|:------------:|
| **PID Display**          | ❌ Shows "-"   | ✅ Shows actual PID |
| **Port Display**         | ❌ Shows "-"   | ✅ Shows actual port |
| **UUID Consistency**     | ❌ Changes each restart | ✅ Persistent across restarts |
| **Delete All Cleanup**   | ❌ Leaves zombies | ✅ Complete cleanup |
| **State Restoration**    | ❌ Partial     | ✅ Complete |
