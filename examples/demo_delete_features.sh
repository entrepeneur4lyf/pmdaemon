echo "   Valid statuses: starting, online, stopping, stopped, errored, restarting"
echo "3. '--force' flag skips confirmation prompts"
echo "4. Running processes are automatically stopped before deletion"
echo
echo "Examples:"
echo "  pmdaemon delete all --force"
echo "  pmdaemon delete stopped --status --force"
echo "  pmdaemon delete errored --status"
echo "  pmdaemon delete online --status  # Stops all running processes"
